###Setup Virtual Environment

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for the Chainlit app, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set it up:
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PiKa919/Medical-Chatbot.git

# Navigate to the project directory
```cd Medical-ChatBot```

# Create a virtual environment
```python -m venv venv```

## Activate the virtual environment
#### On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
#### On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

### Install Packages

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using pip:

bash

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This will install all the dependencies necessary for the Chainlit app to run.
Run Chainlit App

Now that the environment is set up and packages are installed, you can run the Chainlit app:

bash

```python app.py```

Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to access the Chainlit app.
